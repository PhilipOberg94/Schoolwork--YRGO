#Schoolwork--YRGO
Author: Philip Ã–berg

#Overview
This repository contains various schoolwork assignments and projects completed as part of my studies at YRGO. The focus of these projects is primarily on C++, Python, and C programming languages, with a few projects exploring topics like machine learning and signal processing.

#Repository Structure
The repository is structured into different directories, each containing relevant files and documentation for specific tasks:

##ML/: 
Contains files related to machine learning assignments. Current work includes a linear regression program.
##Python/: 
Contains Python programs, showcasing different skills and applications.
.gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in the repository.
#Projects
##Machine Learning (ML)
##Linear Regression Program: This program demonstrates basic machine learning principles through a simple linear regression model. Data import and manipulation are key focuses.
Python
##Automation: Scripts related to automated systems (like the automated horse feeder) and other utility scripts written in Python.
Signal Processing: Includes the frequency analysis file (Frekvensanalys_output.txt) where value labels were updated to reflect recent changes in the signal processing experiments.
#Technologies Used

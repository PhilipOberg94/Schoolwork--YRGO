Schoolwork--YRGO
Author: Philip Ã–berg

Overview
This repository contains various schoolwork assignments and projects completed as part of my studies at YRGO. The focus of these projects is primarily on C++, Python, and C programming languages, with a few projects exploring topics like machine learning and signal processing.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured into different directories, each containing relevant files and documentation for specific tasks:

ML/: Contains files related to machine learning assignments. Current work includes a linear regression program.
Python/: Contains Python programs, showcasing different skills and applications.
.gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in the repository.
Frekvensanalys_output.txt: Results and output from a frequency analysis experiment, documenting the changes made to value labels in signal processing tasks.
Projects
Machine Learning (ML)
Linear Regression Program: This program demonstrates basic machine learning principles through a simple linear regression model. Data import and manipulation are key focuses.
Python
Automation: Scripts related to automated systems (like the automated horse feeder) and other utility scripts written in Python.
Signal Processing: Includes the frequency analysis file (Frekvensanalys_output.txt) where value labels were updated to reflect recent changes in the signal processing experiments.
Technologies Used
C++
Python
C
Git
Machine Learning (ML) Tools: Focus on basic regression techniques

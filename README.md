# Schoolwork--YRGO  
**Author**: Philip Ã–berg

## Overview  
This repository contains various schoolwork assignments and projects completed as part of my studies at YRGO. The focus of these projects is primarily on C++, Python, and C programming languages, with some projects exploring topics like machine learning and signal processing.

## Repository Structure  
The repository is structured into different directories, each containing relevant files and documentation for specific tasks:

- **ML/**: Contains files related to machine learning assignments. Current work includes a linear regression program.
- **Python/**: Contains Python programs showcasing various skills and applications.

## Projects

### Machine Learning (ML)  
- **Linear Regression Program**: A program that demonstrates basic machine learning principles using a simple linear regression model. Data import and manipulation are the main focus areas.

### Python  
- **Automation**: Python scripts for automated systems (e.g., automated horse feeder) and other utility programs.
- **Signal Processing**: Includes a frequency analysis output file (`Frekvensanalys_output.txt`) with updated value labels based on recent changes in signal processing experiments.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Python
- C

## How to Clone the Repository

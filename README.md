Schoolwork--YRGO
Author: Philip Ã–berg

Overview
This repository contains various schoolwork assignments and projects completed as part of my studies at YRGO. The focus of these projects is primarily on C++, Python, and C programming languages, with some projects exploring topics like machine learning and signal processing.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured into different directories, each containing relevant files and documentation for specific tasks:

ML/: Contains files related to machine learning assignments. Current work includes a linear regression program.
Python/: Contains Python programs showcasing various skills and applications.
.gitignore: Specifies files to be ignored in this repository.
Frekvensanalys_output.txt: Contains output from frequency analysis experiments, where value labels have been updated based on recent changes in the signal processing tasks.
Projects
Machine Learning (ML)
Linear Regression Program: A program that demonstrates basic machine learning principles using a simple linear regression model. Data import and manipulation are the main focus areas.
Python
Automation: Python scripts for automated systems (e.g., automated horse feeder) and other utility programs.
Signal Processing: Includes a frequency analysis output file (Frekvensanalys_output.txt) with updated value labels based on recent changes in signal processing experiments.
Technologies Used
 - C++
 - Python
 - C
